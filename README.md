# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-of-Diwali-Sales-using-AI-and-ML-Models
🎆 Exploratory Data Analysis and Predictive Modelling of Diwali Sales using Machine Learning
📘 Overview

This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and building Machine Learning models to analyze Diwali Sales Data.
The goal is to extract actionable insights on customer behavior, spending patterns, and product performance during India’s festive season.

By leveraging AI and ML techniques, the project aims to help businesses make data-driven marketing and inventory decisions during Diwali.

🚀 Features

✅ Data Cleaning and Preprocessing (handling nulls, duplicates)
✅ Exploratory Data Analysis using Python (Matplotlib, Seaborn)
✅ Visualization of customer purchase patterns
✅ Predictive Modelling using Machine Learning algorithms
✅ Evaluation through ROC Curve, R²-score, and Accuracy metrics
